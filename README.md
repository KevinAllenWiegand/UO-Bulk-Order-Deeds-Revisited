# Introduction
This program is the successor to the UO Bulk Order Deeds program I wrote years ago that supported Blacksmithing and Tailoring bulk order deeds.  Since Broadsword has added additional professions and changed the way rewards worked, this new version is set to handle those new changes.

# Getting Started
Not much to do here.  It's a standalone app.  If you download the source, the WPF application is the starting point.

# Build and Test
The code was written with Visual Studio 2017.  I don't know if Visual Studio Code will work or not.  You're on on your own on this part, sorry.

# Contribute
I am not taking direct contributions to the code, but if you have suggestions, please email me at greatpumpkinator@hotmail.com.
